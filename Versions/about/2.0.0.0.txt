This build uses php 8.1.4 for speed improvements via the Just in time compiler and 
preloaded of framework files (enabled by default with docker)<br/>
<br/>
Goodbye to the API system for servers due to lack of use it has been removed, I might return a system like it 
later.<br/>
<br/>
Goodbye to the web panel installer - due to the fact I am needed for first setup anyway the installer is pointless
and adds unneeded complexity. 
<br/>
Goodbye to the R4 import - everyone should be running R7 now and anyone who needs to import can just use version
1.0.2.5 and then update to current.
<br/>
We also switched to YAPF/Bootstrap V2 that runs a bit cleaner as well.
